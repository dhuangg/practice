Background info
1) Typically we name our first html file "index.html" because it is the file that the server is preprogrammed to
serve up first (since it is the index of the website)
2) HTML is a markup language, so it doesn't have any real programming behind it. It just labels text in specific ways that
identifies text to be certain thing on a page. (e.g. <p> text </p> will make the text a paragraph text).
3) CSS is a styling language, which also means it isn't used for programming. It specifies how text should look/be styled.
(e.g. p{color:blue;} will change the text color of anything in a p tag to be blue).
4) In order to make sure your CSS is connected to your HTML file, you need to link the two files within your HTML. Start
with this; you can Google how to do this.

Instructions
1) Using HTML, wrap all of the text you see on the Google homepage in tags.
2) Using HTML, insert the Google logo image onto the file
3) Using HTML, insert the text field and place the two buttons below the Google logo (you may have done this already in step one)
4) Using CSS, position everything to its proper place. For this you will want to learn the "position" property as well as the
 "display" property. Learning the different kinds of values (percentage, pixels, etc.) will also help you a lot.
 5) Using CSS color anything with color.
 6) Put finishing touches on the site so it looks and feels like Google except you can't actually perform a search function....
 or can it?? (if you have time see if you can figure out how to link the Google search engine to your site)
